<h1>Reviews</h1>
<h2>"Overall good quality!"</h2>
<p>The service was good, and the coffee was of high quality. Unfortunately I still failed math even after pulling those all-nighters. Will still recommend to people with long nights ahead!</p>
<h2>"Affordable and worth the price!"</h2>
<p>The food I bought still fit into my measly student budget! The service was fast and came on time, unlike my CS project.</p>
<h2>"The waiters are hot. Five stars."</h2>
<p>This review may not be applicable to your branch. However, the waiters who served me were very kind, and I left them a huge tip. Will visit again.</p>
